## Long Term TODO List/Goals ##

> - Get up to 80% unit test coverage for all modules <br>
<blockquote>- Get build system set up so that analysis of code coverage, checkstyle, etc can be easily monitored<br>
- Create a GUI for users so that all modules can be executed from one central location. <br>
- Refine wikipedia syntax stripping so that obtaining the actual text is a reality (without lots of strange markup)<br>
- Improve the entity recognition/entity extraction module<br>
- User manual for the software<br></blockquote>
